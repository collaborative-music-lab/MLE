Quick porting steps form C to jspainter

- get value with box.getvalueof() instead of x->
- get attributes with box.getattr() instad of x->
- get size from mgraphics instead of rect from view
	var viewsize = mgraphics.size;
	var width = viewsize[0];
	var height = viewsize[1];
- replace jgraphics_ with mgraphics.
- replace (g,? with (
- replace jrgba with rgba
- jgraphics constants like linecap to strings
- Math. prefix for things like sin/cos/PI
- points/rects converted to scalar vars or objects
- define constants as global vars
- if normal has a text field, copy drawtext and modify calc_x/y_offset functions as necessary
- pattern modification methods are called on the object, not on mgraphics, and no need to explicitly destroy a pattern
- if using prims like rectangle_rounded, etc. and don't want autofill on, set mgraphics.autofill=0 in global code
- if using colors with struct dereferencing for red/green/blue/alpha, copy use array_to_color function, and pass in values rather than object to color functions
- if using SVGs you can create a new SVG with new MGraphicsSVG(filename), see ezadc-override.js for an example
